# PassGen

PassGen is a simple application, which may you have guessed, helps you to generate a random password easily and quickly. You can choose the length of the generated password, whether or not it includes numbers, upper case letters, or symbols.

The application is made with Material You design in mind, which means it supports dynamic color and a themed icon. Also, it supports the predictive back gesture.

Disclaimer: dynamic color and themed icon is only supported on Android 12+, while the predictive back gesture is only supported on Android 14+.
